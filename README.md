# Bare Metal Drivers Development
This Project is basically a bare-metal drivers development for  ARM-based microcontrollers . To realize such a project navigating the microcontroller reference manual and datasheet to extract the right  information to professionally  build peripheral drivers and firmware is a must. To achieve this goal, no libraries were used, purely bare-metal embedded-c and register manipulations.
