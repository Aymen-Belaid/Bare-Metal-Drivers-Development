# Bare Metal MCU Drivers Development
This Project is basically a bare-metal drivers development for  ARM-based microcontrollers . To realize such a project navigating the microcontroller reference manual and datasheet to extract the right  information to professionally  build peripheral drivers and firmware is a must. To achieve this goal, no libraries were used, purely bare-metal embedded-c and register manipulations.</br>
The following Project contains the drivers of these peripherals and their application on simple exemples:</br>

- General Purpose Input/Output (**GPIO**)</br>
- universal asynchronous receiver / transmitter (UART)</br>
- General Purpose Timers (**TIM**)</br>
- Analog-to-Digital Converter (**ADC**)</br>
- System Tick Timer (**SysTick**)
- Nested Vector Interrupt Controller (**NVIC**)
